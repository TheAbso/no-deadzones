        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
            Project No Dead-Zones's mission is to give RIT students access
            to wifi in places where it is currently unavailable: the 
            shuttles. This is intended to allow more students to check in
            at shuttles while simultaneously providing a solution to their
            boredom.
        </p>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
            Students wishing to use the wifi only need to login with the 
            same information they would use on any other RIT site upon
            upon attempting to connect to the wifi. After that, you have
            access! Another purpose of this software is to assist with 
            contact tracing.

        <h3>How does contact tracing work?</h3>
        <p>
            Whenever a user's device connects to the shuttle wifi, the time
            at which the connection was made is logged on the NDZ servers, 
            as well as the shuttle the user has connected to. The time at
            which the connection ends is also logged and used to keep track
            of which student potentially came in contact with each other on
            the shuttle.
