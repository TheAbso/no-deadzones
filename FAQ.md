# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is this?
        
Project No Dead-Zones's mission is to give RIT students access
to wifi in places where it is currently unavailable: the 
shuttles. This is intended to allow more students to check in
at shuttles while simultaneously providing a solution to their
boredom.
        
### How does it work? 

Students wishing to use the wifi only need to login with the 
same information they would use on any other RIT site upon
upon attempting to connect to the wifi. After that, you have
access! Another purpose of this software is to assist with 
contact tracing.
     
### How does contact tracing work?

Whenever a user's device connects to the shuttle wifi, the time
at which the connection was made is logged on the NDZ servers, 
as well as the shuttle the user has connected to. The time at
which the connection ends is also logged and used to keep track
of which student potentially came in contact with each other on
the shuttle.
